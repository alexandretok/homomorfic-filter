# Homomorfic Filter using C++ OpenCV

In order to compile the application you should install both QT Creator and OpenCV.

On Ubuntu you can do this by issuing the following command:
´sudo apt-get install ubuntu-sdk libopencv-dev´

Then open the project file (.pro) on QT Creator and click _build and run_.
